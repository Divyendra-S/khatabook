# WiFi Verification Now Enabled by Default

## Summary

WiFi verification has been enabled for all employees and set as the default for future employees.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Database Updates (via Supabase MCP)

**Migration:** `20241023000001_enable_wifi_verification_by_default.sql`

- ✅ **Updated all existing employees** to have `wifi_verification_required = true`
- ✅ **Set column default** to `true` for new employees
- ✅ **Added documentation** comment to the column

### 2. Verification Results

**All Employees Now Have WiFi Verification Enabled:**

- Parul: ✅ `wifi_verification_required = true`
- Test: ✅ `wifi_verification_required = true`
- Tests: ✅ `wifi_verification_required = true`
- Hitesh: ✅ `wifi_verification_required = true`
- Divyendra: ✅ `wifi_verification_required = true`
- New employee: ✅ `wifi_verification_required = true`

**Column Schema:**

- Column: `wifi_verification_required`
- Default Value: `true`
- Nullable: `YES`
- Description: "Whether WiFi verification is required for this user during attendance check-in/check-out. Defaults to true for employees."

## What This Means

### For Existing Employees

- All current employees now require WiFi verification during check-in/check-out
- The WiFi verification modal will appear whenever they mark attendance

### For New Employees

- Any new employee created will automatically have WiFi verification enabled
- HR can still disable it individually if needed through the employee profile

### For HR/Admin

- HR can still manage WiFi verification per employee in the employee profile
- HR can toggle the requirement on/off for specific employees
- HR marking attendance manually can bypass WiFi verification

## How It Works

When an employee checks in or checks out:

1. **WiFi detection runs automatically**
2. **Verification modal shows:**
   - Current WiFi SSID
   - List of office WiFi networks
   - ✅ or ❌ verification status
3. **Attendance proceeds** with WiFi data saved
4. **Database records:**
   - `check_in_wifi_ssid` / `check_out_wifi_ssid`
   - `check_in_wifi_verified` / `check_out_wifi_verified`

## Files Updated

- ✅ Database migration applied via Supabase MCP
- ✅ Local migration file created: `supabase/migrations/20241023000001_enable_wifi_verification_by_default.sql`
- ✅ TypeScript types regenerated: `lib/supabase/types.ts`

## Next Steps

- No action required! The feature is now active.
- Employees will see the WiFi verification modal on their next check-in/check-out.
- HR can manage individual employee settings from the employee profile page.
